# euclid

Higher-Order Euclidean sets are synonoums with Hypereuclidean sets. They are a method of using the maximally-even algorithm recursively to generate many interesting sets for music.

ZIP files: Max/MSP patches that implement rotate-first and subtract-first methods for experimenting with higher-order Euclidean sets. Be sure to install the Bach and Cage libraries, which are available for free in the package manager. The patches can save results in MIDI or XML format for easy exporting to DAWs or musical engraving software.

.cpp files: C++ source code for finding rotate-first and subtract-first methods of finding a single higher-order set, or many higher-order sets.

Development Branch:
Here you can find the newest versions, which work just fine, but may include some features that haven't been tested as thoroughly as the files in the main branch. In the development branch, the Max/MSP patches allow you to make depth-5 sets. There are also a few analysis tools available.
