# euclid
ZIP files: Max/MSP patches that implement rotate-first and subtract-first methods for experimenting with Hypereuclidean sets. Be sure to install the Bach and Cage libraries, which are available for free in the package manager. The patches can save results in MIDI or XML format for easy exporting to DAWs or musical engraving software.

.cpp files: C++ source code for finding rotate-first and subtract-first methods of finding a single Hypereuclid set, or many Hypereuclid sets.
