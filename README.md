# euclid
Still very much under development!

euclidean-02s.maxpat:
Well-tested, working patcher for creating Higher-Order Euclidean sets up to depth 4. Requires Bach and Cage packages to be installed in Max (these are free).

Future goals:
Upload set of C++ files to generate and organize large aggregates of sets using n-ary trees.

I'm still new to this as of summer 2024 -- thanks for your patience and many good wishes to all.
